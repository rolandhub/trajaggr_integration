Title: Meaningful aggregation of trajectory data in R
Authors@R: person("Roland", "Harhoff", role = c("cre", "aut"), email =

Description: The package 'trajaggr' provides S4 generic methods for meaningful
    aggregation of trajectory data represented by objects defined in the R
    package 'trajectories'. It includes methods for spatio-temporal overlay of
    'Track' objects with 'Spatial' objects defined in package 'sp' and STF
    objects defined in package 'spacetime'. On basis of the 'over' methods for
    spatio-temporal overlay also 'aggregate' methods are provided to aggregate
    'Track', 'Tracks' or 'TracksCollection' objects over 'Spatial' or 'STF'
    objects. Moreover a method 'count' is provided, that may be used to count
    the number of trajectory objects over 'Spatial' or 'STF' objects. To enable
    the usage and analysis of (animal) trajectory objects represented by
    classes defined in other R packages, in particular in the packages 'move'
    and 'adehabitatLT', bidirectional coercion methods are implemented, that
    provide coercion between objects defined in 'trajectotries' and objects
    defined in 'move' and 'adehabitatLT'.
