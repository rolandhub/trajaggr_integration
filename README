### INSTALLATION ###
There are no issues about the installation.

### R CMD check ###

# move package problem

If calling R CMD check with the current version of the move package installed,
one gets a warning related to a clean unloading of the namespace. In particular:
Error in .mergeMethodsTable(generic, mtable, get(tname, envir = env),  : ...

This warning is caused by < setClass("ltraj") > in line 20 of the file move2ade.R from the move package.
(Due to the fact that 'ltraj' is a S3 class the 'setClass' does not make any sense.)

(An adjusted move package is provided, that avoids that warning.)

The implemented generic coercion methods related to class 'ltraj' currently just work with the adjusted move package.
To avoid problems in creating the vignette these generic coercion methods are not illustrated in the vignette.
#


### Two further issues ###

##
# Time zone difference in tracksCollectionData and in Track time slots in conjunction with "foreign" time zones

Related to the current release of the package trajectories (Version 0.1-1) on cran:
When creating TracksCollection objects from Track objects with a "forgein" timezone, 
the time data in tracksCollectionData (tmin, tmax) differs from the time data in the time slots of the Track objects , 
that are part of the TracksCollection.

An proposed adjusted version of the package trajectories is provided on GITHUB:

https://github.com/BenGraeler/trajectories

(It was tried to avoid using the tracksCollectionData time in the vignette and in the tests.)

##
# Coercion from trajectories objects to MoveStack or MoveBurst objects

For some (suspicious) reason the methods to coerce Tracks and TracksCollection objects to 
MoveStack objects or Tracks to MoveBurst need an explicit loading of the move or at least of the sp package,
although both packages are "imported".
