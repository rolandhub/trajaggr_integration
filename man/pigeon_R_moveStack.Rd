\description{
Example data from movebank stored in an object of
class \code{MoveStack}. The object contains two trajectories of a pigeon individual.
}
\details{
The pigeons data come from a project, that studied the leadership-based flock structures of homing
pigeons (Columba livia). In particular the repeatability of leadership-based flock structures was studied
within a flight and across multiple flights conducted with the same animals.

The \code{MoveStack} object contains two trajectories of a pigeon individual.
It is a subset from the original data set. It contains 480 trajectory points sampled over a period
of 2 minutes. The sampling rate is regular with four samples per second.

The permission to use the data was obtained from the owners of the data (Contact person: Carlos David Santos).

For further details please see the vignette.
