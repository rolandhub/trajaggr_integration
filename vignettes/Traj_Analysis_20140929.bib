	abstract = {Background
The Conditional Autoregressive ({CAR}) model is widely used in many small-area ecological studies to analyse outcomes measured at an areal level. There has been little evaluation of the influence of different neighbourhood weight matrix structures on the amount of smoothing performed by the {CAR} model. We examined this issue in detail.

Methods
We created several neighbourhood weight matrices and applied them to a large dataset of births and birth defects in New South Wales ({NSW}), Australia within 198 Statistical Local Areas. Between the years 1995–2003, there were 17,595 geocoded birth defects and 770,638 geocoded birth records with available data. Spatio-temporal models were developed with data from 1995–2000 and their fit evaluated within the following time period: 2001–2003.

Results
We were able to create four adjacency-based weight matrices, seven distance-based weight matrices and one matrix based on similarity in terms of a key covariate (i.e. maternal age). In terms of agreement between observed and predicted relative risks, categorised in epidemiologically relevant groups, generally the distance-based matrices performed better than the adjacency-based neighbourhoods. In terms of recovering the underlying risk structure, the weight-7 model (smoothing by maternal-age 'Covariate model') was able to correctly classify 35/47 high-risk areas (sensitivity 74\%) with a specificity of 47\%, and the 'Gravity' model had sensitivity and specificity values of 74\% and 39\% respectively.

Conclusion
We found considerable differences in the smoothing properties of the {CAR} model, depending on the type of neighbours specified. This in turn had an effect on the models' ability to recover the observed risk in an area. Prior to risk mapping or ecological modelling, an exploratory analysis of the neighbourhood weight matrix to guide the choice of a suitable weight matrix is recommended. Alternatively, the weight matrix can be chosen a priori based on decision-theoretic considerations including loss, cost and inferential aims.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of Geographical Information Systems ({GIS}) in health organisations, together with the proliferation of spatially disaggregate data, has led to a number of studies that have been concerned with developing measures of access to health care services. The main aim of this paper is to review the use of {GIS}-based measures in exploring the relationship between geographic access, utilisation, quality and health outcomes. The varieties of approaches taken by researchers concerned with teasing out the relative importance of geographical factors that may influence access are examined. To date, in the absence of detailed data on health utilisation patterns, much of this research has focused on developing measures of potential accessibility. This paper then critically evaluates the situation with regard to the use of such measures in a broad range of accessibility studies. In particular, there has been less research to date that examines the relationship between such measures and health outcomes. In the final sections of the paper, I draw on the review to outline areas where a broader research agenda is needed, particularly in relation to more recent innovations in health care delivery.},

	abstract = {A 2-year rat feeding study with genetically modified {NK}603 maize sparked an international scientific and public debate as well as policy responses by the European Commission. The European Food Safety Authority ({EFSA}) evaluated the study as defective based on conceptual and methodological shortcomings by retroactive application of the recommendations of its recent guidance on 90-day feeding studies. Our comparative analysis of the three relevant {NK}603 publications, including a 90-day feeding study of Monsanto, showed that all of them satisfy or fail to satisfy the {EFSA} evaluation criteria to a comparable extent; the rejection of only one of the papers is, thus, not scientifically justified. We also show that {EFSA}'s criteria are not standard practice in 21 other rat feeding studies lasting at a minimum of 12 months. The review reveals critical double standards in the evaluation of feeding studies submitted as proof of safety for regulatory approval to {EFSA}. We specifically argue that the current approach to declare statistically significant differences between genetically modified organisms and its parents as ‘biologically irrelevant’ based on additional reference controls lacks scientific rigor and legal justification in the European Union ({EU}) system. Only recently, the {EU} authorities started building up an implementing system based on its own legislation and supportive of the {EU} approach to risk assessment in the context of technology assessment. Until these issues are resolved, we do not expect that neither the public nor the scientific debate will subside.},

This paper demonstrates one such application, to the measurement of levels of accessibility and distributional equity offered by a system of public parks. The methods proposed are relatively simple; nevertheless, they do offer substantial improvements upon those previously utilized by leisure service providers. They facilitate identification of poorly served areas and populations, and suggest where new facilities might best be sited so as to maximize access and equity. These methods are illustrated by a case study of the park system in Bryan, Texas. Many other applications of {GIS} to leisure service provision are available, several of which are briefly discussed. Together, they could enable agencies to function more effectively and, ultimately, to provide better levels of service to the public.},

	abstract = {With increasing concern about rising rates of obesity, public health researchers have begun to examine the availability of parks and other spaces for physical activity, particularly in cities, to assess whether access to parks reduces the risk of obesity. Much of the research in this field has shown that proximity to parks may support increased physical activity in urban environments; however, as yet, there has been limited consideration of environmental impediments or disamenities that might influence individuals’ perceptions or usage of public recreation opportunities. Prior research suggests that neighborhood disamenities, for instance crime, pedestrian safety, and noxious land uses, might dissuade people from using parks or recreational facilities and vary by neighborhood composition. Motivated by such research, this study estimates the relationship between neighborhood compositional characteristics and measures of park facilities, controlling for variation in neighborhood disamenities, using geographic information systems ({GIS}) data for New York City parks and employing both kernel density estimation and distance measures. The central finding is that attention to neighborhood disamenities can appreciably alter the relationship between neighborhood composition and spatial access to parks. Policy efforts to enhance the recreational opportunities in urban areas should expand beyond a focus on availability to consider also the hazards and disincentives that may influence park usage.},

Overall, this literature is not characterized by a particular attention to the importance of method in drawing conclusions about spatial equity based on empirical studies. Specifically, there has been scant interest in the effect of geographic methodology on assessing the relationship between access and socioeconomic characteristics that are spatially defined. In this paper we take a spatial analytical perspective to evaluate the importance of methodology in assessing whether or not, or to what degree the distribution of urban public services is equitable. We approach this issue by means of an empirical case study of the spatial distribution of playgrounds in Tulsa, Oklahoma, relative to that of the targeted constituencies (children) and other socioeconomic indicators. In addition to the 'traditional' measure (count of facilities in an areal unit), we consider a potential measure (based on the gravity model), average travel distance, and distance to the nearest playground as indicators of accessibility. We find significant differences between the spatial patterns in these measures that are suggested by local indicators of spatial association and other techniques of exploratory spatial data analysis. The choice of access measure not only implies a particular treatment of spatial externalities but also affects conclusions about the existence of spatial mismatch and inequity.},

Spatial accessibility within urban areas can nonetheless pose a challenge, especially for minorities and low-income urban residents who are more likely to depend on public transportation. To examine spatial and temporal accessibility to mammography facilities in the Atlanta metropolitan area by public and private transportation, we built a multimodal transportation network model including bus and rail routes, bus and rail stops, transfers, walk times, and wait times. Our analysis of travel times from the population-weighted centroids of the 282 census tracts in the 2-county area to the nearest facility found that the median public transportation time was almost 51 minutes. We further examined public transportation travel times by levels of household access to a private vehicle. Residents in tracts with the lowest household access to a private vehicle had the shortest travel times, suggesting that facilities were favorably located for women who have to use public transportation. However, census tracts with majority non-Hispanic black populations had the longest travel times for all levels of vehicle availability. Time to the nearest mammography facility would not pose a barrier to women who had access to a private vehicle.

	abstract = {The total area of urban parks in Seoul is approximately 158 km2 which is fairly large compared to those in other cities around the world. Although this figure may seem favorable, in actuality major portions of the parks in the city are located in outer areas so that frequent opportunities to visit them are relatively minimal. Such disparity between statistics and actual usability comes mainly from the inconvenient location of the parks. Using the network analysis method of {GIS}, this study analyzed pedestrian accessibility to urban parks in Seoul and the subsequent serviceability of the parks. Study results indicated that first, the total service area of the urban parks identified by network analysis was 249 km2, which was approximately half of the service area analyzed by the conventional simple buffering method. Next, the spatial distribution of parks in the five sub-regions (northwest, northeast, central, southwest, and southeast) of Seoul was then evaluated in terms of serviceability indices—i.e. service area ratio, service population ratio, and service floor area ratio. Finally, urban parks in Seoul were found to have been inadequately distributed in relation to population, land use, and development density. Park serviceability in the northern part of the city in particular was determined to be the most problematic. Considering the actual locations of parks and the corresponding local population and land use, the approach conducted in this study provided practical ways of understanding and managing spatial distribution of urban parks.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Both recognizing human behavior and understanding a user’s mobility from sensor data are critical issues in ubiquitous computing systems. As a kind of user behavior, the transportation modes, such as walking, driving, etc., that a user takes, can enrich the user’s mobility with informative knowledge and provide pervasive computing systems with more context information. In this paper, we propose an approach based on supervised learning to infer people’s motion modes from their {GPS} logs. The contribution of this work lies in the following two aspects. On one hand, we identify a set of sophisticated features, which are more robust to traffic condition than those other researchers ever used. On the other hand, we propose a graph-based post-processing algorithm to further improve the inference performance. This algorithm considers both the commonsense constraint of real world and typical user behavior based on location in a probabilistic manner. Using the {GPS} logs collected by 65 people over a period of 10 months, we evaluated our approach via a set of experiments. As a result, based on the change point-based segmentation method and Decision Tree-based inference model, the new features brought an eight percent improvement in inference accuracy over previous result, and the graph-based post-processing achieve a further four percent enhancement.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

First it attempts to create a new methodology for measuring objective accessibility to public spaces (such as parks, schools and shops) at the neighborhood scale and second it investigates the distribution of such spaces by examining the socio-economic status of citizens. The goal is achieved by applying a new and straightforward method of {GIS} and fuzzy logic. This methodology was applied in the study area and the results presented in the form of tables and maps. The results revealed that there are spatial disparities in some parts of the area with lower accessibility to such spaces.

Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the {FCA} method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model.

These techniques can be described as ratio, least-cost path, and allocation methods. The ratio method is the most common and simply measures the population-to-{GP} ratio for a given area. The least-cost path and allocation techniques rely on {GIS} network analysis and provide information on travel times and distances. The allocation analysis differs from least-cost path analyses because it considers the number of {GPs} available and this acts as a capacity constraint. The use of {GIS} network analysis can produce a number of different statistics on accessibility that can be visualized as a map. This article will argue that the use of a capacity constraint is important and that the population further than 30 minutes from a {GP} is an effective statistic for comparing the accessibility of different management regions.},

	abstract = {Physical inactivity is one of the most important public health issues in the U.S. and internationally. Increasingly, links are being identified between various elements of the physical—or built—environment and physical activity. To understand the impact of the built environment on physical activity, the development of high-quality measures is essential. Three categories of built environment data are being used: (1) perceived measures obtained by telephone interview or self-administered questionnaires; (2) observational measures obtained using systematic observational methods (audits); and (3) archival data sets that are often layered and analyzed with {GIS}. This review provides a critical assessment of these three types of built-environment measures relevant to the study of physical activity. Among perceived measures, 19 questionnaires were reviewed, ranging in length from 7 to 68 questions. Twenty audit tools were reviewed that cover community environments (i.e., neighborhoods, cities), parks, and trails. For {GIS}-derived measures, more than 50 studies were reviewed. A large degree of variability was found in the operationalization of common {GIS} measures, which include population density, land-use mix, access to recreational facilities, and street pattern. This first comprehensive examination of built-environment measures demonstrates considerable progress over the past decade, showing diverse environmental variables available that use multiple modes of assessment. Most can be considered first-generation measures, so further development is needed. In particular, further research is needed to improve the technical quality of measures, understand the relevance to various population groups, and understand the utility of measures for science and public health.},

	abstract = {Background 
Differences in availability of recreational resources may contribute to racial and socioeconomic status ({SES}) disparities in physical activity. Variations in the location and density of recreational resources were examined by {SES} and racial composition of neighborhoods. 
Methods 
Densities of resources available in recreational facilities and parks were estimated for census tracts between April 2003 and June 2004 in North Carolina, New York, and Maryland using kernel estimation. The probability of not having a facility or park was modeled by tract racial composition and {SES}, adjusting for population and area, using binomial regression in 2006. Mean densities of tract resources were modeled by {SES} and racial composition using linear regression. 
Results 
Minority neighborhoods were significantly more likely than white neighborhoods not to have recreational facilities (relative probability [{RP}]=3.27 [95\% {CI}=2.11–5.07] and 8.60 [95\% {CI}=4.48–16.51], for black and Hispanic neighborhoods, respectively). Low-income neighborhoods were 4.5 times more likely to not have facilities than high-income areas (95\% {CI}=2.87–7.12). Parks were more equitably distributed. Most resources located in recreational facilities required a fee and were less dense in minority and low-income areas. Those located inside parks were usually free to use, sports-related, and denser in poor and minority neighborhoods. 
Conclusions 
Recreational facilities and the resources they offer are not equitably distributed. The presence of parks in poor and minority areas suggest that improving the types and quality of resources in parks could be an important strategy to increase physical activity and reduce racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities.},

A sample of 1349 people in and around Oslo in Norway exposed to railway noise was studied in a cross-sectional survey to obtain data on sleep disturbances, sleep problems due to noise, and personal characteristics including noise sensitivity. Individual noise exposure levels were determined outside of the bedroom facade, the most-exposed facade, and inside the respondents' bedrooms. The exposure-response relationships were analyzed by using logistic regression models, controlling for possible modifying factors including the number of noise events (train pass-by frequency). L(p,A,eq,night) and L(p,A,max) were significantly correlated, and the proportion of reported noise-induced sleep problems increased as both L(p,A,eq,night) and L(p,A,max) increased. Noise sensitivity, type of bedroom window, and pass-by frequency were significant factors affecting noise-induced sleep disturbances, in addition to the noise exposure level. Because about half of the study population did not use a bedroom at the most-exposed side of the house, the exposure-response curve obtained by using noise levels for the most-exposed facade underestimated noise-induced sleep disturbance for those who actually have their bedroom at the most-exposed facade.},

	abstract = {Recent research suggests living in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood is associated with decreased likelihood of undergoing mammography and increased risk of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis. Long distances and travel times to facilities offering low- or no-fee mammography may be important barriers to adherence to mammography screening recommendations for women living in economically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods, in which African-Americans are disproportionately represented. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the spatial distribution of facilities providing low- or no-fee screening mammography in Chicago, Illinois, is equitable on the basis of neighborhood socioeconomic and racial characteristics. We found that distance and travel times via automobile and public transportation to facilities generally decrease as neighborhood poverty increases. However, we also found that the strength of the association between neighborhood poverty level and two of the spatial accessibility measures-distance and public transportation travel time-is less strong in African-American neighborhoods. Among neighborhoods with the greatest need for facilities (i.e., neighborhoods with the highest proportions of residents in poverty), African-American neighborhoods have longer travel distances and public transportation travel times than neighborhoods with proportionately fewer African-American residents. Thus, it appears that the spatial accessibility of low- and no-fee mammography services is inequitable in Chicago. In view of persistent social disparities in health such as breast cancer outcomes, these findings suggest it is important for researchers to examine the spatial distribution of health resources by both the socioeconomic and racial characteristics of urban neighborhoods.},

We found that the intensity of neighbourhood destination opportunities varied considerably among cities and between neighbourhoods within cities. Further, access to neighbourhood infrastructural support tends to be better in more socially deprived places. Potential explanations for the sociospatial distribution of neighbourhood destinations in New Zealand cities include historical processes of residential and economic development and infrastructural investment.},

	abstract = {The inequitable geographic distribution of health care resources has long been recognized as a problem in the United States. Traditional measures, such as a simple ratio of supply to demand in an area or distance to the closest provider, are easy measures for spatial accessibility. However the former one does not consider interactions between patients and providers across administrative borders and the latter does not account for the demand side, that is, the competition for the supply. With advancements in {GIS}, however, better measures of geographic accessibility, variants of a gravity model, have been applied. Among them are (1) a two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method and (2) a kernel density ({KD}) method. This microscopic study compared these two {GIS}-based measures of accessibility in our case study of dialysis service centers in Chicago. Our comparison study found a significant mismatch of the accessibility ratios between the two methods. Overall, the 2SFCA method produced better accessibility ratios. There is room for further improvement of the 2SFCA method—varying the radius of service area according to the type of provider or the type of neighborhood and determining the appropriate weight equation form—still warrant further study.},

The built environment encompasses a range of physical and social elements that make up the structure of a community and may influence obesity. This review summarizes existing empirical research relating the built environment to obesity. The Medline, {PsychInfo}, and Web of Science databases were searched using the keywords “obesity” or “overweight” and “neighborhood” or “built environment” or “environment.” The search was restricted to English-language articles conducted in human populations between 1966 and 2007. To meet inclusion criteria, articles had to 1) have a direct measure of body weight and 2) have an objective measure of the built environment. A total of 1,506 abstracts were obtained, and 20 articles met the inclusion criteria. Most articles (84\%) reported a statistically significant positive association between some aspect of the built environment and obesity. Several methodological issues were of concern, including the inconsistency of measurements of the built environment across studies, the cross-sectional design of most investigations, and the focus on aspects of either diet or physical activity but not both. Given the importance of the physical and social contexts of individual behavior and the limited success of individual-based interventions in long-term obesity prevention, more research on the impact of the built environment on obesity is needed.},

{METHODS}: A literature search of academic and grey literature was conducted for studies and reviews of the health effects of green space. Articles found were appraised for their relevance, critically reviewed and graded accordingly. Their findings were then thematically categorized.
{RESULTS}: There is weak evidence for the links between physical, mental health and well-being, and urban green space. Environmental factors such as the quality and accessibility of green space affects its use for physical activity. User determinants, such as age, gender, ethnicity and the perception of safety, are also important. However, many studies were limited by poor study design, failure to exclude confounding, bias or reverse causality and weak statistical associations.
{CONCLUSION}: Most studies reported findings that generally supported the view that green space have a beneficial health effect. Establishing a causal relationship is difficult, as the relationship is complex. Simplistic urban interventions may therefore fail to address the underlying determinants of urban health that are not remediable by landscape redesign.},

	abstract = {Background
Well-designed public open space ({POS}) that encourages physical activity is a community asset that could potentially contribute to the health of local residents.
Methods
In 1995–1996, two studies were conducted—an environmental audit of {POS} over 2 acres (n =516) within a 408-km2 area of metropolitan Perth, Western Australia; and personal interviews with 1803 adults (aged 18 to 59 years) (52.9\% response rate). The association between access to {POS} and physical activity was examined using three accessibility models that progressively adjusted for distance to {POS}, and its attractiveness and size. In 2002, an observational study examined the influence of attractiveness on the use of {POS} by observing users of three pairs of high- and low-quality (based on attractiveness) {POS} matched for size and location.
Results
Overall, 28.8\% of respondents reported using {POS} for physical activity. The likelihood of using {POS} increased with increasing levels of access, but the effect was greater in the model that adjusted for distance, attractiveness, and size. After adjustment, those with very good access to large, attractive {POS} were 50\% more likely to achieve high levels of walking (odds ratio, 1.50; 95\% confidence level, 1.06–2.13). The observational study showed that after matching {POS} for size and location, 70\% of {POS} users observed visited attractive {POS}.
Conclusions
Access to attractive, large {POS} is associated with higher levels of walking. To increase walking, thoughtful design (and redesign) of {POS} is required that creates large, attractive {POS} with facilities that encourage active use by multiple users (e.g., walkers, sports participants, picnickers).},

	abstract = {Spatio-temporal clustering is a process of grouping objects based on their spatial and temporal similarity. It is relatively new subfield of data mining which gained high popularity especially in geographic information sciences due to the pervasiveness of all kinds of location-based or environmental devices that record position, time or/and environmental properties of an object or set of objects in real-time. As a consequence, different types and large amounts of spatio-temporal data became available that introduce new challenges to data analysis and require novel approaches to knowledge discovery. In this chapter we concentrate on the spatio-temporal clustering in geographic space. First, we provide a classification of different types of spatio-temporal data. Then, we focus on one type of spatio-temporal clustering - trajectory clustering, provide an overview of the state-of-the-art approaches and methods of spatio-temporal clustering and finally present several scenarios in different application domains such as movement, cellular networks and environmental studies.},

To some authors "access" refers to entry into or use of the health care system, while to others it characterizes factors influencing entry or use. The purpose of this article is to propose a taxonomic definition of "access." Access is presented here as a general concept that summarizes a set of more specific dimensions describing the fit between the patient and the health care system. The specific dimensions are availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability and acceptability. Using interview data on patient satisfaction, the discriminant validity of these dimensions is investigated. Results provide strong support for the view that differentiation does exist among the five areas and that the measures do relate to the phenomena with which they are identified.},

	abstract = {Ensuring equity of access to primary health care ({PHC}) across Canada is a continuing challenge, especially in rural and remote regions. Despite considerable attention recently by the World Health Organization, Health Canada and other health policy bodies, there has been no nation-wide study of potential (versus realized) spatial access to {PHC}. This knowledge gap is partly attributable to the difficulty of conducting the analysis required to accurately measure and represent spatial access to {PHC}. The traditional epidemiological method uses a simple ratio of {PHC} physicians to the denominator population to measure geographical access. We argue, however, that this measure fails to capture relative access. For instance, a person who lives 90 minutes from the nearest {PHC} physician is unlikely to be as well cared for as the individual who lives more proximate and potentially has a range of choice with respect to {PHC} providers. In this article, we discuss spatial analytical techniques to measure potential spatial access. We consider the relative merits of kernel density estimation and a gravity model. Ultimately, a modified version of the gravity model is developed for this article and used to calculate potential spatial access to {PHC} physicians in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. This model incorporates a distance decay function that better represents relative spatial access to {PHC}. The results of the modified gravity model demonstrate greater nuance with respect to potential access scores. While variability in access to {PHC} physicians across the test province of Nova Scotia is evident, the gravity model better accounts for real access by assuming that people can travel across artificial census boundaries. We argue that this is an important innovation in measuring potential spatial access to {PHC} physicians in Canada. It contributes more broadly to assessing the success of policy mandates to enhance the equitability of {PHC} provisioning in Canadian provinces.},
